## Machine Learning Problems

**Choose proper word(s) to describe the following tasks.**
- Supervised Learning 
- Unsupervised Learning 
- Not Learning
- Classification 
- Regression 
- Clustering 
- Dimensionality Reduction
1. Automatically group thousands of art paintings by similar artistic styles. (Clustering)
2. Play sudoku by searching the whole action space to find the possible solution. (Not Learning)
3. Recognize handwritten digits by looking for the most similar image in a large dataset of labeled digit images, then use its label as result. (Supervised Learning)
4. Visualize very high dimensional data in 2D or 3D space. (Dimensionality Reduction)
5. Based on former patients’ records, predict the success rate of a surgery for a new patient. (Regression)
6. Given thousands of peoples’ names and sexes, decide a new person’s name is male or female. (Classification)
7. Discover communities of people in a social network. (Clustering)
8. Using historical stock prices, predict stock price in the future. (Regression)
9. Represent image as a well chosen 64 bits integer, so that similar images will be represented as integers with small hamming distance. (Unsupervised Learning)

**True or False:**
“To fully utilizing available data resource, we should use all the data we have to train our learning model and choose the parameters that maximize performance on the whole dataset.” Justify your answer. 

**False**. Because not all the data is valualbe, some dirty data or nosiy data is bad for model.
